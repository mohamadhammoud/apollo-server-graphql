# Apollo Server Template with Express and Node.js

Welcome to the **Apollo Server Template with Express and Node.js** repository! This template is designed to help you build a GraphQL server using Apollo Server, Express, and Node.js. It provides you with a solid foundation for developing GraphQL-based applications quickly and efficiently.

## :computer: What is this Template?

The Apollo Server Template with Express and Node.js is a boilerplate project that sets up a GraphQL server using Apollo Server with Express and Node.js. It provides a basic configuration and structure to get you started with your GraphQL API development. You can use this template to build various types of applications, from simple prototypes to large-scale production-ready projects.

## :zap: Features

- Integration of Apollo Server with Express and Node.js for GraphQL API development :rocket:
- A simple yet robust folder structure for organizing your GraphQL schema, resolvers, and other components :file_folder:

## :star2: What's Inside

This project includes:

- \`server.js\`: The main entry point of the application that sets up the Apollo Server and Express.
- \`type-definitions\`: The GraphQL schema definition file where you can define your data types and queries.
- \`resolvers\`: The foler where you implement the resolvers for your GraphQL queries and mutations.
- \`database\`: An example data folder that you can use to test your API before connecting to a database.
- \`package.json\`: The package configuration file that lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- \`README.md\`: This file, providing information about the template and how to use it.

## :rocket: Get Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamadhammoud/apollo-server-graphql.git
cd apollo-server-graphql
\`\`\`

2. Install the dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Start the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Open your browser and go to \`http://http://localhost:3000/graphql\` to access the GraphQL Playground. Here, you can interact with your API and test your queries and mutations.
